An interactive cookie-clicker game.

(Required)
ðŸŽ¯ Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.

- Wireframe
- Planning
- Style button
- Event listener for cookie button
- reset button
- CSS animation for button
- API displayed on the page

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?

- I could not seem to get a few things working, The button to buy an item, the interval tick for the cookies per second and local storage to save cookies.

ðŸŽ¯ If so, could you please tell us what it was that you found difficult about these tasks?

- Mainly it was the time that was the limiting factor, this was worked on for approximately 10 hours.
- I struggled to get the buy buttons to take an amount from the total cookie amount, I'm not sure whether it has something to do with how I've linked to the amount, how I'm linking to the IDs placed during the shop upload or something else entirely.
- I'm not too familiar with handling cookies and local storage, an issue popped up in my console and I haven't had the chance to solve this issue.

Overall, I'm happy with what I have achieved in the time, but I also feel this has highlighted a few things I don't understand that well and can learn from. I also would have loved to have had the chance to put more effort into this and I am looking forward to approaching a project like this in the future with more knowledge and time.
