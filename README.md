(Required)
ðŸŽ¯ Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.

- Wireframe
- Planning
- Style button
- Event listener for cookie button
- reset button
- CSS animation for button
- API displayed on page

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?

- I could not seem to get a few things working, The button to buy an item, the interval tick for the cookies per second.

ðŸŽ¯ If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

- Mainly it was the time that was the limiting factor, this was worked on for approx 8-10 hours.
- For some reason I struggled to get the buy buttons to take an amount from the total cookie amount, i'm not sure wether it's something to do with how i've linked to the amount or how i'm refering to the id's placed during the shop upload.
- I'm not to familiar with handling cookies and local storage, an issue popped up in my console and I havnt had the chance to solve this issue.

Overall, i'm happy with what I have acheived in the time, but I also feel this has highlighted a few things I don't understand that well and can learn from. I also would have loved to have had the chance to put more effort into this and am looking foward to approaching a project like this in the future with more knowledge.
